# Digital Logbook for Open Source Lab 
The OSL Digital Logbook is a project developed to enable users to log their entries using a digital logbook.
It is designed specifically for Open Source Lab (OSL) and can improvised to use for any entry system with minor changes in the code.
The logbook allows users to scan a QR code and log their entry into the lab. Before logging in, users must first register 
using a domain-specific email and verify their registration using OTP. 
The project is built using Node.js and MongoDB

## Features
- QR code scanning for logging entries, providing a quick and efficient process.
- Domain-specific email registration and OTP verification for user authentication.
